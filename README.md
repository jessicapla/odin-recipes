# odin-recipes
The Odin Project recipes project

First project in TOP. 

This is a website that consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

During this project, I will practice making the standard HTML boilerplate, using headers, paragraphs, lists, creating hyperlinks and adding images to a webpage.
